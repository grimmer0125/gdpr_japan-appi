| Consent requirement | Data controllers need to clearly tell the individual the purpose of collecting data, the used law, how long it will retain, and if it will be shared with any third party. Users need to explicitly opt-in. Alternatively, this notice and consent could be fulfilled in the process of some contract (agreement).<br><br>Sensitive data need to require consent explicitly.<br><br>There are some exception cases and do not need users’ consent and most are about the public interest. <br><br>The consent is on the parent side of the data subject is below 16 years old (the member nation can change to 13 years old) | For non-sensitive data, a personal information handling business operator should specify its usage purpose.

| Obligations of data controller/processor (business), some are listed in below individual cells | Data controllers and data processors have some obligations to follow and the former has bigger obligations. For example, <br><br>All data require high-security protection, such as pseudonymization which could be implemented by encryption or anonymization. | A personal information handling business operator needs to take some security control. It also needs to keep personal data up to date and delete the data without delay if the purpose has become unnecessary. |
| Pseudonymously processed information handling business operator | no this under GDPR | In 2020 rev. law, a pseudonymously processed information handling business operator can collect personal data, as long as it applies pseudonymization on the personal data and makes its usage purpose public. The limitation is it can not be shared with third parties. This business will be beneficial for internal usage, and there is no deletion requirement due to purpose. |
| Record of activities | The data controller/data processor needs to record activities if they meet some criteria. E.g., the number of employees exceeds 250. | no this in APPI |
| DPO (Data protection officer) | Data controller/processor needs to have a DPO if they meet some criteria, e.g. regularly processing data from a large scale of data subjects. DPO is to make sure everything complies with GDPR. | no this in APPI<br><br>APPI requires the business to have some supervision of employees to have good security control of the personal data. |
| Reporting data breaches | They are needed to be reported to national supervisory authorities within 72 hours if there is some adverse effect on user privacy. | APPI’s equivalent act covers data damage and loss in addition to data leakage. If it happens, business operators should notify the PIPC (Personal Information Protection Commission, 個人情報保護委員会) and the principal of the occurrence. If some action (e.g. high-security encryption level) is taken or the person is hard to inform, no need to notify the principal. If the data is from other business operators, and just need to notify the other business operators without notifying PIPIC and the principal of the occurrence. |
| Penalties | up to €20 million or 4% of the annual worldwide turnover | 100 million yen |

GDPR is more for the minimal authorization principle and APPI is to try to get the balance between individuals and businesses.
